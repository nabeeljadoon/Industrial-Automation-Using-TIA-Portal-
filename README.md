# Industrial-Automation-Using-TIA-Portal-
This project presents industrial-level package control and punching machine control using Siemens TIA Portal and Integration with Simatic PLCSIMSIM

**1. Project Overview**

This project focuses on designing and implementing **PLC-based automation** for:
1. **Punching Machine Control System**
2. **Compressor Package Control System**

Developed using **Siemens TIA Portal**, this automation system improves operational efficiency, reduces human intervention, and enhances safety measures. 

**2. Key Features & Implementation**

### **Punching Machine Control**
- **Automated Sequence:** System Ready → Start → Guard Down → Punch Operation → Reset.
- **Safety Mechanisms:** Emergency stop, interlocks, fault detection.
- **PLC Logic:** Implemented in **Ladder Logic (LAD)** with timers, sensors, and counters.

### **Compressor Package Control**
- **Startup & Shutdown Logic** based on pressure monitoring.
- **Overheat & Overpressure Protection** for enhanced safety.
- **Real-time Monitoring** via **HMI Interface**.

### **VMware Setup for Development**
- **Virtualized Siemens TIA Portal** using **VMware Workstation** for simulation.
- **PLCSIM & HMI Configuration** tested in a **virtual PLC environment**.
- Ensured smooth integration between **SCADA, PLC, and automation networks**.

**3. Tools & Technologies**
- **Siemens S7-1200/S7-1500 PLCs** with TIA Portal.
- **Virtualized Environment** via VMware for efficient simulation.
- **Ladder Logic, Function Block Diagram (FBD)** for programming.
- **Timers, Counters, and Safety Interlocks** for automation control.

**4. Expected Outcomes**
- **Optimized Industrial Automation** for Punching & Compressor control.
- **Enhanced Safety & Fault Detection Mechanisms.**
- **Scalable Design** for future IoT/SCADA integration.
- **Fully Virtualized Development Workflow** using VMware.
